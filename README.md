# Data Provenance Analysis

This repository contains all the necessary files for analyzing data provenance using Cypher queries, a Large Language Model (LLM) approach, and the associated research paper. The repository is organized into three main components: Cypher queries, a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the LLM approach, and the research paper.

## Introduction

This project leverages the power of Neo4j and Cypher to analyze provenance graphs. It includes:
- A collection of Cypher queries for provenance analysis.
- A Jupyter notebook implementing a Large Language Model (LLM) approach to interact with the Neo4j graph.
- A comprehensive research paper detailing the methodology and findings.
